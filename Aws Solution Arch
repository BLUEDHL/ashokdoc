Elastic Network Interface: 
eth0
A network interface can include the following attributes:
    1. A primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
	2. One Elastic IP address (IPv4) per private IPv4 address
	3. One public IPv4 address
	4. One Public IPv4 Address 
	5. A MAC address 
	6. one or more security groups
	7. One instance can have multiple IP address
	Scenarios for Network Interface 
	1. To create low budget high avaliability solution
	2. creating a managment network
	    In this secnario the public ip connected to eth0 primiary and secound eth1 can be used to managment of backend process.
		for example : the public facing allowing a security group of port 80, 443, while the secoundary group allow only port number 22
    * with the eni we can attach a two security groups to a single instance.
	  why we have to create two security groups : ex : we can use ne security for behind the load balancer and other for backend access , good security practise also
