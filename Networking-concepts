Networking Concepts:

Overlay Networking:

A. It is a method of creating a layer of network abstractions that can be run multiple seperate, discrere virtualized network layers on top of the physical network.
   All the nodes are connected with one another by means of virtual IP correspond to a path in the underlaying network(It will create a tunnel)
 
Layer 2: it is a data link where data packets are encoded and decoded into bits.
         The MAC sub layer controls how a computer on the network gains access to the data and permission.

Layer 3(Overlay): 
   

Flannel: very easy to use, No network policy support
WeaveNet: support network policy, support encryption with IPsec for all traffic b/w nodes. easy to use, well support
